# ImpetusKidsApp

Android App for a pre-primary school 'Impetus Kids'  to ease the process of communication between parents and teachers.
Hence, we tried to bring the entire administration in a single app.
There were two types of users - Teacher and Parent
Tech Stack - Language Used was Java and Firebase database was used.

## Functionalities of the App:
1) Announcements - The teacher can post announcements via the app and these can be viewed by the parents.
2) Leave Request - The Parent can generate a leave request and the teacher can approve it.
3) Homework - The teacher can post daily homework on the app which can be viewed by the parents.
4) Syllabus Coverage - The teacher can post syllabus coverage of all the subjects.
5) Memories/Gallery - The teacher can upload pictures of events held in the school.
6) Live CCTV - Parents can view live CCTV coverage of their child's classroom.
7) Authorized Person/ Emergency Person - Parents can upload a picture as well as the contact details of the authorized person who can collect their child from school besides them.
